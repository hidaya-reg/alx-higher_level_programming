# Code Breakdown
```python
@patch('sys.stdout', new_callable=StringIO)
def test_display(self, mock_stdout):
    r = Rectangle(3, 2)
    expected_output = "###\n###\n"

    r.display()  # Call the method to generate output
    # Compare the captured output to the expected output
    self.assertEqual(mock_stdout.getvalue(), expected_output)
```
## 1. Decorator ``@patch('sys.stdout', new_callable=StringIO)``:
- This line is a decorator from the ``unittest.mock`` module. It temporarily replaces ``sys.stdout`` (the standard output stream, where print statements send their output) with a new instance of ``StringIO``.
- ``new_callable=StringIO`` means that instead of writing output to the console, any output that would normally go to ``sys.stdout`` will be captured in this ``StringIO`` object.
## 2. Function Definition:
- ``def test_display(self, mock_stdout)``: defines a test method. The first parameter ``self`` refers to the instance of the test class (typically a subclass of ``unittest.TestCase``), and ``mock_stdout`` is the instance of ``StringIO`` created by the ``patch`` decorator.
- The ``mock_stdout`` parameter allows you to access the output captured in the ``StringIO`` object.
## 3. Creating a Rectangle Instance:
``r = Rectangle(3, 2)`` creates an instance of the Rectangle class with a width of 3 and a height of 2. This instance will later be used to call the ``display()`` method.
## 4. Expected Output:
``expected_output = "###\n###\n"`` defines what you expect to see printed to the console when you call ``r.display()``. In this case, for a rectangle of width 3 and height 2, the expected output is two rows of three ``#`` characters, followed by newline characters.
## 5. Calling the Method:
``r.display()`` invokes the ``display()`` method of the ``Rectangle`` class. This method prints the representation of the rectangle using ``#`` characters. However, instead of printing to the console, the output goes to the ``StringIO`` object because ``sys.stdout`` has been patched.
## 6. Capturing Output:
``mock_stdout.getvalue()`` retrieves the contents of the ``StringIO`` object. At this point, it contains whatever was "printed" during the ``r.display()`` method call.
## 7. Assertion:
- ``self.assertEqual(mock_stdout.getvalue(), expected_output)`` checks if the captured output (from ``mock_stdout``) matches the ``expected_output``.
- If they match, the test passes; if they don't, the test fails, indicating that the ``display()`` method did not produce the expected output.
