How to Use 2-matrix_divided.py
===============================

This module defines a matrix division function ``matrix_divided(matrix, div)``.

Usage
=====

``matrix_divided(...)``` returns a new matrix where all elements of the input
matrix are divided by `div` and rounded to 2 decimal places.

::

    >>> matrix_divided = __import__('2-matrix_divided').matrix_divided

Divide an empty matrix by 3 (should return an empty matrix):

::

    >>> matrix = []
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 3)
    []

Divide a 1x1 matrix by 5:

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [10]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 5)
    [[2.0]]

Divide a 2x2 matrix by 2:

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2],
    ...     [3, 4]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    [[0.5, 1.0], [1.5, 2.0]]

Divide a matrix by 2.5 (floating-point divisor):

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [10, 20, 30],
    ...     [40, 50, 60]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2.5)
    [[4.0, 8.0, 12.0], [16.0, 20.0, 24.0]]

Divide a matrix by 1 (no change expected):

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 1)
    [[1.0, 2.0, 3.0], [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]]

Divide a matrix by 0 (should raise ZeroDivisionError):

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2],
    ...     [3, 4]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Matrix with non-numeric values (should raise TypeError):

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, "three"],
    ...     [4, 5, 6]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: matrix must be a matrix (list of lists) of integers/floats

Rows with different sizes (should raise TypeError):

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2, 3],
    ...     [4, 5]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 2)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    TypeError: Each row of the matrix must have the same size

Divide a matrix by 0.0 (should raise ZeroDivisionError):

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1, 2],
    ...     [3, 4]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0.0)
    Traceback (most recent call last):
        ...
    ZeroDivisionError: division by zero

Divide a matrix by 0.5:

::

    >>> matrix = [
    ...     [1.5, 2.0, 3.5],
    ...     [4.0, 5.5, 6.0]
    ... ]
    >>> matrix_divided(matrix, 0.5)
    [[3.0, 4.0, 7.0], [8.0, 11.0, 12.0]]
