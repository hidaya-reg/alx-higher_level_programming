The difference between the two operations is due to how the + operator and the += operator work in Python, especially with mutable objects like lists.

## ``a = a + [5]``
- When you write ``a = a + [5]``, a new list is created that contains the contents of ``a`` plus the new element ``[5]``.
- The result is assigned back to ``a``, but ``a`` now refers to a new list object in memory.
- That's why the ``id(a)`` changes after the operationâ€”you're assigning a completely new list to ``a``.
## ``a += [6]``
- The ``+=`` operator, also known as "in-place addition," modifies the original list directly.
- In this case, ``a`` is not reassigned; instead, the list itself is updated to include the new element ``[6]``.
- The ``id(a)`` remains the same because no new object is created; the existing list is modified in place.
Summary
- ``+`` **creates a new list**, resulting in a new object with a new memory address.
- ``+=`` **modifies the list in place**, so the original list's memory address remains unchanged
